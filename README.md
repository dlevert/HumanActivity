# Human Activity


The goal of this project is to get, combine, clean, and summarize data from
the Human Activity datasets.

Project Name: run_analysis.R

The project will import the files in this repository, combine and clean them
into a single data set named "data".
it uses the source filesfrom the working directory as structured in the repo:
features.txt
        X_test.txt
        y_test.txt
        subject_test
        X_train.txt
        y_train.txt
        subject_train.txt
        activity_labels.txt
it then generates a summarized table names "sumdata" and returns the mean by of
all the mean and standard deviation variables grouped by activity and subject.

This project exists as an assignment for a class. This is an representation
of my current socing capabilities. The original dataset and readme files are
included and must remain in the file structure in the repo.

Codebooks for both the detailed and summary datasets are included in the root 
directory.

Include any essential instructions for:

You can get it at "https://github.com/dlevert/HumanActivity.git"

To install it just download the Repo and retain the file structure, 
Load "HumanActivity.Rproj" into R.

Simply run the "run_analysis.R()" function to produce the output summarized
table.
